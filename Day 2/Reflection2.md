# Reflection 2

This was a pretty tough notebook for me to complete. I couldn't understand the documentations too well for me to implement the models in my own. However, I eventually figured out how these models work in the bonus exercise. I chose a neural network as my third model and decided to take their cross-values as a measuring metric for all the three models. This difficulty can be quite an obstacle, but I'm still progressing fairly well.
