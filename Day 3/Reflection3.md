#Reflection

Here is where we really dive into the world of deep learning. The assignment is now getting a little bit difficult with all the command lines and dataset generations I have to work through. The utilization of different classifiers and my first time using a neural network have been very rough but informative that prepares me for my own implementations later on. Challenged but definitely still excited.
