#Reflection

This introduction to Tensorflow has been fun! The new data type is certainly similar to the existence of numpy arrays that allow us to manipulate it more conveniently to perform deep learning. Although it was hard grasping the matrices and all the different command lines, I hope this do not impact me later on in future notebooks, but practice will be key!
