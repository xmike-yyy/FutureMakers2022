Reflection:


  The first day of MIT FutureMakers was certainly tough to do. I enjoyed a lot of these coding challenges but certainly could not complete the zigzag matrix assignment. 
  The other problems are also rigorous that excites me for the assignments moving forward, especially with the project.
